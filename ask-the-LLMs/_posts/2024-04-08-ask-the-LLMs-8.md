What is Billie Eilish's 8th album?

## Gemini:

### Billie Eilish does not have an 8th album. 

As of November 2023, Billie Eilish has released two studio albums:

* **When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?** (2019)
* **Happier Than Ever** (2021)

She has also released one EP, **Don't Smile at Me** (2017), and several singles. 

It's possible that you may have heard a rumor about an 8th album, but this is not accurate information. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

## ChatGPT:

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Billie Eilish has not released eight albums. In fact, as of that time, Billie Eilish had released one studio album titled "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" which was her debut album released in 2019. She has also released an EP titled "Don't Smile at Me" in 2017. It's important to note that the information may have changed since then, so it's worth checking for any updates on Billie Eilish's discography to confirm the latest releases.
